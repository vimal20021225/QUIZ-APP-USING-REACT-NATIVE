# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.\
The page will reload whenever you make changes. Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for performance.\
The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for cache busting.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This action is irreversible!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configurations, you can eject.\
This copies all config files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving full control.\
While you can still use other commands, they'll reference the copied scripts.\
Ejecting is optional and recommended for advanced customization.
